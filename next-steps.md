### Next Steps:
1. Validate the updated script against real SPICE simulation outputs with a prepared CSV file.
2. Enhance further for compatibility with JSON or other formats if needed.
3. Integrate logging with a robust logger (e.g., Logback) for better diagnostics in larger systems.

Let me know if additional improvements or verifications are required!
