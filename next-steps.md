### Next Steps:
1. Validate the updated script against real SPICE simulation outputs with a prepared CSV file.
2. Enhance further for compatibility with JSON or other formats if needed.
3. Integrate logging with a robust logger (e.g., Logback) for better diagnostics in larger systems.


It seems the `gradlew` script is missing in your project directory. This script is part of Gradle's wrapper, which allows you to run Gradle commands without needing a system-wide Gradle installation. Hereâ€™s how you can address this issue:

---

### Steps to Fix the Error

#### 1. Verify Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`) Script:
- Check the project root directory (`/Volumes/a/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/java`) for the `gradlew` file:
  ```bash
  ls /Volumes/a/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/java
  ```
- If `gradlew` is missing, you need to:
  - Install Gradle manually.
  - Generate the wrapper in the project.

#### 2. Install Gradle (If Needed):
- Install Gradle on your system using Homebrew (macOS):
  ```bash
  brew install gradle
  ```
- Verify the installation:
  ```bash
  gradle -v
  ```

#### 3. Generate Gradle Wrapper:
- Run the following command in the project directory:
  ```bash
  gradle wrapper
  ```
- This will create the `gradlew` and associated files.

#### 4. Add OpenCSV Dependency to `build.gradle`:
- Update the `build.gradle` file manually or via the command:
  ```bash
  echo "dependencies {
      implementation 'com.opencsv:opencsv:5.6'
  }" >> /Volumes/a/digital-logic/FullAdderProject/java/build.gradle
  ```

#### 5. Sync the Dependencies:
- Run the Gradle build to sync dependencies:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew build
  ```

After resolving the `gradlew` issue, proceed with compiling and validating `SpiceValidation.java` using the updated library.
