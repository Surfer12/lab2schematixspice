Below is a point‐by‐point look at why this netlist is not behaving as intended and how you can straighten it out.  In short, **the biggest issue is that your subcircuit pin lists (the `.subckt` lines) do not match the internal transistor connections**.  Each subcircuit references signals like `A` and `B` inside its MOSFET statements, but in the `.subckt …` line you have named the pins `C`, `D`, `E`, etc.  LTspice then interprets those mismatches as floating or mislabeled nodes—resulting in an incorrect (or failed) simulation.

Below is an annotated walkthrough of the problems and one possible fix.

---

## 1. Mismatch of Subckt Pins vs. Internal Signals

Take your `NAND` definition as an example:

```plaintext
.subckt NAND C D NAND
M1 NAND A N001 N001 Sp2025P
M2 NAND B N001 N001 Sp2025P
M3 NAND A N002 N002 Sp2025N
M4 N002 B 0 0       Sp2025N
V1  N001 0 5
.ends NAND
```

- In the `.subckt NAND C D NAND` line, you are telling LTspice that:
  - Pin 1 = `C`
  - Pin 2 = `D`
  - Pin 3 = `NAND`  (the output node)
- **Inside** the subcircuit, though, you use `A` and `B` for the transistor gates.
- That means signals `A` and `B` never get driven by the top‐level nets `C` and `D`.
- As a result, the MOSFETs end up on the wrong nets or floating.

A similar mismatch happens in your `NOR` and `INVERT` subcircuits:
```plaintext
.subckt NOR E B NOR
; ...
M1 NOR A N002 N002 Sp2025P  ; <— "A" does not match "E"
; ...
```
and
```plaintext
.subckt INVERT C NA
; ...
M1 NA A N001 N001 Sp2025P   ; <— "A" is not declared in pin list
; ...
```
where the pin lists say `E`, `B` or `C`, `NA`, but the transistor lines use `A`, `B`, etc.

### **How to fix it**
Either **rename** the transistor‐gate nodes inside each subcircuit to match the pins declared on the `.subckt` line, **or** rewrite your `.subckt` line so the pins match the internal naming.  For example, if you want a 2‐input NAND subcircuit named `NAND(in1, in2, out)`, you could do:

```plaintext
.subckt NAND in1 in2 out
M1 out in1 pnode pnode PMOS
M2 out in2 pnode pnode PMOS
M3 out in1 nnode nnode NMOS
M4 nnode in2 0     0     NMOS
V1 pnode 0 5
.ends NAND
```
Now the net names inside the transistors (`in1`, `in2`, `out`) match the subckt pins exactly.  Or you could rename them consistently—just be sure that what you call “A” or “B” inside the subckt lines up with the first and second pins you pass from the top level.

---

## 2. Inconsistent Pin Ordering in the X‐Element Calls

At the top level you do things like:
```plaintext
X§X1 A N006 N004 NAND
```
which means (in the current netlist):
1. `A` is passed in for subckt pin 1 (which you labeled `C`)
2. `N006` is passed in for subckt pin 2 (which you labeled `D`)
3. `N004` is passed in for subckt pin 3 (which you labeled `NAND`)

So after your subckt fix, ensure you consistently pass `(A, N006, N004)` if that’s truly `(in1, in2, out)`.

---

## 3. The “ORx” and “INVERT” Subcircuits Have the Same Problem

Take `INVERT`:
```plaintext
.subckt INVERT C NA
M1 NA A N001 N001 Sp2025P
M4 NA A 0    0    Sp2025N
V1 N001 0 5
.ends INVERT
```
- Pin 1 = `C`, Pin 2 = `NA`.
- But inside the MOSFET lines you use `A` as the gate.
- If you want an inverter with input = `C` and output = `NA`, rewrite it so that you consistently connect them, for example:
  ```plaintext
  .subckt INVERT in out
  M1 out in pnode pnode PMOS
  M2 out in 0     0     NMOS
  V1 pnode 0 5
  .ends INVERT
  ```
  Then your call at top level might be `X§X3 N005 N006 INVERT` where `N005` = input, `N006` = output, etc.

Similarly with `ORx`:
```plaintext
.subckt ORx A B ORx
X§X1 A B N001 NOR
X§X2 N001 ORx INVERT
.ends ORx
```
- You declare a subckt with pins: `(A, B, ORx)` → presumably that means two inputs + an output.
- Inside, you call `X§X1 A B N001 NOR`, so that is presumably your intermediate “NOR” result.  Then `X§X2 N001 ORx INVERT` inverts that result, which yields `(A OR B)`.
- Again, just make sure the “NOR” subckt is pinned consistently, or else your signals get miswired.

## 4. Putting It All Together

Below is a small example of how you might *correct* the NAND subckt (as an illustration).  You can apply the same idea to NOR, INVERT, and ORx:

```plaintext
********************************************************************
* 2-input NAND subckt with correct pin usage
********************************************************************
.subckt NAND in1 in2 out

* PMOS stack
M1 out in1 pnode pnode PMOS
M2 out in2 pnode pnode PMOS

* NMOS stack
M3 out in1 nnode nnode NMOS
M4 nnode in2 0    0    NMOS

* Local VDD rail for transistors
VDD pnode 0 5

.ends NAND
```

Then at top level:
```plaintext
X1 A N006 N004 NAND   ; (A, N006) → inputs, N004 → output
```
will cleanly pass your net `A` to subckt pin `in1`, `N006` to pin `in2`, and `N004` to `out`.

Repeat that consistent naming in your “NOR,” “INVERT,” and “ORx” macros, so that their interior MOSFET references match the subckt pins.  Once all subckt calls align with the internal transistor references, your half‐adder logic (and ultimately your sum and carry waveforms) should appear correctly in the simulator.

---

### Bottom Line

1. **Rename** pins in each `.subckt` so that they match the signals inside the MOSFET statements.
2. **Call** each subcircuit (the `X###` lines) in the same pin order you declared in `.subckt`.
3. Check that any “internal supply rails” or “internal net names” inside the subckt do not accidentally clash with your top‐level nets.

With those fixes in place, LTspice should be able to simulate your half‐adder stages and produce the expected `Sum[0]` and `Carry[0]`.
